# ACL Concepts Explained

This guide explains the Active Directory Access Control List (ACL) concepts that ACLGuard analyzes, helping you understand the security implications of different permissions.

## üîê What are ACLs?

Access Control Lists (ACLs) in Active Directory define who can access what resources and what actions they can perform. Think of them as security rules that control:

- **Who** can access a resource (users, groups, computers)
- **What** they can do with it (read, write, delete, etc.)
- **Where** these permissions apply (specific objects, containers, or the entire domain)

## üèóÔ∏è AD Permission Structure

### Security Principals
- **Users**: Individual accounts (e.g., john.doe)
- **Groups**: Collections of users (e.g., Domain Admins)
- **Computers**: Machine accounts (e.g., SERVER01$)
- **Service Accounts**: Accounts used by applications

### Permission Types
- **Standard Permissions**: Basic operations (read, write, delete)
- **Extended Permissions**: Advanced operations (reset password, modify ACLs)
- **Special Permissions**: Granular control over specific attributes

## üéØ High-Risk Permissions Analyzed by ACLGuard

### 1. Admin Privileges

**What it means:**
- Full administrative access to the domain or forest
- Can create, modify, or delete any object
- Bypasses most security restrictions

**Common Groups:**
- `Domain Admins`: Full domain control
- `Enterprise Admins`: Full forest control
- `Schema Admins`: Can modify the AD schema
- `Group Policy Creator Owners`: Can create/modify GPOs

**Security Risk:**
- **üî¥ CRITICAL**: Complete system compromise possible
- **Attack Vector**: Privilege escalation, lateral movement
- **Real-world Impact**: Okta breach, SolarWinds attack

### 2. Password Reset Permissions

**What it means:**
- Can reset passwords for other users
- Often includes unlocking locked accounts
- May include password policy modifications

**Common Groups:**
- `Account Operators`: Can manage user accounts
- `Help Desk`: Password reset for end users
- `Password Admins`: Dedicated password management

**Security Risk:**
- **üü† HIGH**: Account takeover possible
- **Attack Vector**: Social engineering, insider threats
- **Real-world Impact**: Common in ransomware attacks

### 3. ACL Modification (WriteDACL)

**What it means:**
- Can modify access control lists
- Can grant permissions to other users
- Can change object ownership

**Common Groups:**
- `Backup Operators`: Can modify ACLs during backup operations
- `Server Operators`: Server management permissions
- `Print Operators`: Print server management

**Security Risk:**
- **üü° MEDIUM-HIGH**: Permission escalation possible
- **Attack Vector**: ACL backdoors, privilege escalation
- **Real-world Impact**: Common persistence mechanism

### 4. Authentication Delegation

**What it means:**
- Can delegate authentication to other services
- Can impersonate users on behalf of services
- Can configure service principal names (SPNs)

**Common Groups:**
- `Delegation Admins`: Manage delegation settings
- `Trust Admins`: Manage domain trusts
- `Service Accounts`: Often have delegation rights

**Security Risk:**
- **üü† HIGH**: Kerberos delegation attacks
- **Attack Vector**: Constrained/unconstrained delegation abuse
- **Real-world Impact**: Common in advanced persistent threats

### 5. Service Account Privileges

**What it means:**
- Accounts used by applications and services
- Often have elevated permissions
- May have "Password Never Expires" set

**Common Examples:**
- `SQL Service`: Database service accounts
- `IIS Service`: Web server accounts
- `Exchange Service`: Email server accounts

**Security Risk:**
- **üü° MEDIUM**: Service account compromise
- **Attack Vector**: Service account abuse, privilege escalation
- **Real-world Impact**: Common in supply chain attacks

### 6. Secret Access Permissions

**What it means:**
- Can read sensitive attributes (passwords, certificates)
- Can write sensitive configuration data
- Access to encrypted data

**Common Scenarios:**
- `Read Secrets`: Can view password hashes
- `Write Secrets`: Can modify sensitive data
- `Certificate Access`: Can manage certificates

**Security Risk:**
- **üü† HIGH**: Data exfiltration possible
- **Attack Vector**: Credential theft, data breach
- **Real-world Impact**: Common in data breaches

## üéØ Risk Scoring Methodology

### Risk Calculation
ACLGuard uses a weighted scoring system:

```c
// Base risk scores
Admin Privileges:        +40 points
Authentication Delegation: +30 points
Write Secrets:           +35 points
Password Reset:          +25 points
Read Secrets:            +20 points
ACL Modification:        +20 points
Service Account:         +15 points

// Risk levels
0-19:   üü¢ MINIMAL
20-39:  üîµ LOW
40-59:  üü° MEDIUM
60-79:  üü† HIGH
80-100: üî¥ CRITICAL
```

### Why These Scores?

**Admin Privileges (40 points):**
- Complete system control
- Can bypass all security measures
- Primary target for attackers

**Authentication Delegation (30 points):**
- Enables sophisticated attacks
- Difficult to detect
- Common in advanced threats

**Write Secrets (35 points):**
- Can modify critical data
- Enables persistence
- High impact on security

## üö® Real-World Attack Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Okta-Style Breach
1. **Initial Access**: Compromise service account
2. **Privilege Escalation**: Use service account to reset admin passwords
3. **Lateral Movement**: Use admin privileges to access other systems
4. **Data Exfiltration**: Access sensitive data with elevated permissions

### Scenario 2: SolarWinds-Style Attack
1. **Supply Chain**: Compromise software update mechanism
2. **Service Account Abuse**: Use service account with high privileges
3. **ACL Modification**: Create backdoors in access control lists
4. **Persistence**: Maintain access through modified permissions

### Scenario 3: Ransomware Attack
1. **Phishing**: Compromise user account
2. **Password Reset Abuse**: Use help desk privileges to reset admin passwords
3. **Domain Admin Access**: Gain full domain control
4. **Encryption**: Encrypt all accessible systems

## üõ°Ô∏è Mitigation Strategies

### For Admin Privileges
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only grant admin rights when necessary
- **Just-in-Time Access**: Temporary admin privileges
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Require MFA for admin accounts
- **Regular Auditing**: Monitor admin account usage

### For Password Reset Permissions
- **Approval Workflows**: Require approval for password resets
- **Audit Logging**: Log all password reset activities
- **Time Restrictions**: Limit password reset hours
- **Notification Systems**: Alert users of password resets

### For ACL Modification
- **Change Management**: Require approval for ACL changes
- **Baseline Monitoring**: Detect unexpected ACL modifications
- **Regular Reviews**: Periodic ACL audits
- **Automated Alerts**: Notify on suspicious changes

## üìä Best Practices

### Regular Monitoring
- **Daily**: Check for new high-risk permissions
- **Weekly**: Review permission changes
- **Monthly**: Comprehensive permission audit
- **Quarterly**: Risk assessment review

### Documentation
- **Permission Justification**: Document why permissions are needed
- **Business Owner**: Identify who requested permissions
- **Review Date**: Set expiration dates for permissions
- **Risk Assessment**: Document security implications

### Automation
- **Automated Scanning**: Regular ACLGuard runs
- **SIEM Integration**: Feed results into security monitoring
- **Alert Systems**: Notify on high-risk changes
- **Reporting**: Generate management reports

## üîç Advanced Concepts

### Inheritance
- Permissions can be inherited from parent containers
- Understanding inheritance is crucial for effective analysis
- Blocking inheritance can create security gaps

### Delegation
- Granular permission delegation
- Can be more secure than group membership
- Requires careful management

### Trust Relationships
- Cross-domain permission implications
- Forest trust security considerations
- External trust risks
